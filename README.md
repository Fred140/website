The "Symfony Demo Application" is a reference application created to show how to develop applications following the Symfony Best Practices.

You can also learn about these practices in the official Symfony Book.

Requirements
PHP 8.2.0 or higher;
PDO-SQLite PHP extension enabled;
and the usual Symfony application requirements.

Option 1. Download Symfony CLI and use the symfony binary installed on your computer to run this command:

symfony new --demo my_project

Option 2. Download Composer and use the composer binary installed on your computer to run these commands:

# you can create a new project based on the Symfony Demo project...
composer create-project symfony/symfony-demo my_project

# ...or you can clone the code repository and install its dependencies
git clone https://github.com/symfony/demo.git my_project
cd my_project/
composer install

Usage

There's no need to configure anything before running the application. There are 2 different ways of running this application depending on your needs:

Option 1. Download Symfony CLI and run this command:

cd my_project/
symfony serve

Then access the application in your browser at the given URL (https://localhost:8000 by default).

Option 2. Use a web server like Nginx or Apache to run the application (read the documentation about configuring a web server for Symfony).

On your local machine, you can run this command to use the built-in PHP web server:

cd my_project/
php -S localhost:8000 -t public/

Tests

Execute this command to run tests:

cd my_project/
./bin/phpunit
